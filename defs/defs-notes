to do:
make new folder hierarchy and template for building with webpack

/defs -- includes template
/css
/assets
/build << do we need this? not sure..


LibDefsIO.js
LibDefsUI.js
init.json

webpack.config.js


not really liking that the ui creates a bundle but the io uses the default script, 
pretty much just cosmetic, but still...
