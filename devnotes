consider making override option for drawsocket.send
so it could be cleaner to switch between browser and electron
(overriding to ipcRenderer.send)

# short term to do
- update from gui doens't work with stave because the getObjViewContext function doesn't go all the way to the svg elment,
    however, this also makes me wonder if maybe staves shouldn't be redrawn based on the info ... 
        but that's not right, of course it should, for example, you might have a 5 line staff and want to change the clef, 
            that could be an attribute of the 5 line stave


- selction in staves doesnt' work
- add expression composition interface
