consider making override option for drawsocket.send
so it could be cleaner to switch between browser and electron
(overriding to ipcRenderer.send)

# short term to do
- update from gui doens't work with stave because the getObjViewContext function doesn't go all the way to the svg elment,
    however, this also makes me wonder if maybe staves shouldn't be redrawn based on the info ... 
        but that's not right, of course it should, for example, you might have a 5 line staff and want to change the clef, 
            that could be an attribute of the 5 line stave


- add expression composition interface

user scripts

on new object click
    symbolistEvent creates new data object and generates view from data

    sequece could be:
    - UI event, sends new click notice and class name to controller
        controller creates data from symbol def, data creates view
        - then def calls custom UI to edit the object
            do we have a data from view?
                newFromClick, mappings, transform do this
                better to make a function for that?
    or
    - UI event, 

on palette selection:
1) enters create symbol UI, sets limits and range of possible creation,
    for example, quantized to scale degrees etc.

on selection:
1) enter symbol UI, which sets possible types of transformation (translation mode)

after selection
1) possibility to go into edit mode, similar to creation mode


so for general selection, we can keep the drag area rect
in illustrator there are different tools that can perform the same types of actions on the objects
in symbolist right now you need to hold down the cmd key which is like selecting the symbol palette icon to create the symbol, rather than selecting -- maybe this is still an interesting why to go...

sine we may sill want to create symbols by drawing rather than importing them.

TO DO:
revise symbols to use modes to customize the UI

translation should not necesarily be a built in edit UI, for example maybe translation means somethind different in different contexts. the idea from before was that the stave would define a concept of organization of it's symbols, be it in time, or some other aspect, like space
