consider making override option for drawsocket.send
so it could be cleaner to switch between browser and electron
(overriding to ipcRenderer.send)

# short term to do
- update from gui doens't work with stave because the getObjViewContext function doesn't go all the way to the svg elment,
    however, this also makes me wonder if maybe staves shouldn't be redrawn based on the info ... 
        but that's not right, of course it should, for example, you might have a 5 line staff and want to change the clef, 
            that could be an attribute of the 5 line stave


- add expression composition interface

user scripts

on new object click
    symbolistEvent creates new data object and generates view from data

    sequece could be:
    - UI event, sends new click notice and class name to controller
        controller creates data from symbol def, data creates view
        - then def calls custom UI to edit the object
            do we have a data from view?
                newFromClick, mappings, transform do this
                better to make a function for that?
    or
    - UI event,
